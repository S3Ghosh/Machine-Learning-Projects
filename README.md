# Project: Customer Segmentation Analysis 

# Problem Statement
There is a famous mall and it wants to get insights about its customers. They have basic customer data  like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

# Analysis
In this project we will analyse and group customers based on their spending patterns and purchase behaviour. I have built a model that can cluster customers into different groups. One group of customers may represent those who purchase more in the mall. Another group may represent people who do not buy much from the mall. Having these groups of customers will give better insights and helps the mall make better business decisions and marketing strategies.
